These are my most recent up to date configs as of 10/09/2018

Keep in mind these configs are made for my play style so they may not work for you.

If you have any problems/questions/suggestions post them on my discord

Don't use the "NoSpread" config in VAC Secured servers

*** I don't use Aimware very often and these configs may be out of date (Check above) use these as a way to make your own configs
don't expect them to work perfectly for you. ***

*** This will probably be the last time I give out my configs as I don't use Aimware very often. ***

[Installation]
Copy all of the configs from the folder.

Press win+r.

Type %appdata%.

Find a folder with a random string of letters and numbers (hhVGlUdklnQMGrFxRRn).

Inside that folder should be another folder (VPLuaUB).

Now paste my configs into there.

Now either start your game or if you're already injected go to the "settings" tab and click refresh.
